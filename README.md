# Comick-Hitory-extraction
PY script to extract data from your browser (i.e. Firefox :P) related to comics you viewed on Comick (RIP).
Beta script for gecko & chromium is available but was not extensively tested. User discretion is advised if you want to use it.

The goal of this this script is to get a list of comic pages you've visited from the the Firefox profile files (places.sqlite). This is just a temporary band aid for anyone who would like to get a list of comics they viewed in the past.
The script reads your history & bookmarks and writes the unique entries to a SQLITE database (I highly recommend to instal the https://sqlitebrowser.org as the file is indexed and ready to read).
The script is provided 'as-it-is'. If you want more browsers or more functions you have my permission to use it as the base for your own creation. ;)
